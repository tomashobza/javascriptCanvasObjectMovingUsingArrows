# javascriptCanvasObjectMovingUsingArrows
I made simple code, so you can move square in canvas using arrows.

It is very simple, you just clearing the older ones and creating new rectangles. For ex.: when you click the right button, you add 10px to the y variable and create new rectangle with same x, but y=y+10.

I hope, this is usefull for you. :)
